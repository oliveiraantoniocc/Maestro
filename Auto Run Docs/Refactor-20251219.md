# Maestro Codebase Refactoring Audit - Phase I

> **Purpose:** Systematically examine the Maestro codebase for dead, deprecated, duplicated, and otherwise problematic code that requires refactoring.
>
> **Instructions:** For each numbered task below, examine the specified file(s) or directory. Document your findings in `Auto Run Docs/Refactor/{TASK_NUMBER}.md` covering ALL of these categories:
>
> 1. **Dead Code:** Unused exports, unreachable code paths, commented-out code blocks, unused imports, unused variables/functions
> 2. **Deprecated Patterns:** Outdated APIs, legacy approaches, old React patterns (class components, legacy lifecycle), callback-style async, manual DOM manipulation
> 3. **Duplication:** Similar logic repeated across files, copy-pasted code blocks, functions that could be consolidated, repeated type definitions
> 4. **Code Smells:** Overly complex functions (>50 lines), deep nesting (>3 levels), poor separation of concerns, missing error handling, magic numbers/strings, god objects/functions
> 5. **Type Safety Issues:** `any` types, missing type annotations, unsafe casts (`as`), non-null assertions (`!`), implicit any, weak typing
>
> **IMPORTANT:** Each task MUST examine ALL five categories above. Do not skip any category - if nothing is found, explicitly state "None found" for that category.
>
> **Output Format:** Each task document should follow this template:
> ```markdown
> # Refactor Task {NUMBER}: {FILE/DIRECTORY NAME}
